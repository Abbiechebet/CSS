    <h3><i><b>What I have learnt so far and how CSS is important</b></i></h3>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS uses the box model to tell web browsers how to display and space different elements on a web page. All websites are made up of a series of boxes and these boxes have four major components that is margin, border, padding and content.</p>
    <p>It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.</p>

    <h3><i><b>The difference between padding margin and borders</b></i></h3>
    <p><b>Padding</b> is the inner space between the content and the border of your box. </p>
    <p><b>Border</b> is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above.</p>
    <p><b>Margin</b> is the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box</p>
